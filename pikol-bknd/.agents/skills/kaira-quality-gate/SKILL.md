# Code Quality Gate in pikol-bknd

Before reporting that any feature, refactor, or bug fix is finished, you **MUST** run Kaira's quality suite to prevent regressions.

---

## 1. The Quality Gate Command

```bash
kaira quality
```

* **Shortcut:** `kaira q`

### What Kaira Quality Checks:
1. **Linter & Formatter**: Validates style with `ruff`.
2. **Type Checker**: Validates type safety with `mypy`.
3. **Security Audit**: Scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
4. **Configuration State**: Confirms `.kaira.json` integrity.

## 2. Running Test Suites

Always verify that existing and new endpoints pass pytest:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```
