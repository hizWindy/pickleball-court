# Synchronizing Layers in pikol-bknd

When you manually add or modify a field in an ORM model inside `models/<model>.py`, the other 4 layers (Schemas, Repositories, Services, Routers) can quickly become out of sync.

Use Kaira's **Sync Engine** to automatically detect differences and cascade the updates.

---

## Canonical Command

```bash
kaira sync model <ModelName>
```

* **Shortcut:** `kaira sm <ModelName>`

### Example
```bash
# After adding 'discount_price: float' to models/product.py:
kaira sync model Product
```

---

## What the Sync Engine Does

1. **Introspects** the modified model in `models/<model>.py`.
2. **Updates Schemas** (`schemas/<model>_schema.py`): Adds the new field to `Create`, `Update`, and `Response` DTOs.
3. **Updates Repositories** (`repositories/<model>_repository.py`): Ensures query builders and filters accept the field.
4. **Updates Services** (`services/<model>_service.py`): Propagates payload handling.
5. **Updates State**: Synchronizes `.kaira.json` metadata.

## Safety Guidelines

- Run `kaira diff <ModelName>` before syncing if you want to preview the exact lines that will be updated.
- Never manually delete fields in schemas without verifying dependent router handlers.
